# godotcolor-vim
Theme inspired by GDScript editor in Godot Engine.

**Highlighting is not perfectly replicated. I just made it for my own use.** 

Theme file has been changed on top of the one from this repository:  
https://github.com/tomasr/molokai

Theme was edited to invert status bar colors for better custom statusbar support.
